In this project i developed an IA that learns how to play Flappy Bird, until it becomes invincible!

HOW IT WORKS
the script creates many agents (or players) that try to play the game. It uses a genetic algorithm to select the best players and reuse them for the next generation of new better ones.
the players use a Neural Network to decide if and when to jump, using as input their x and y position in the game space.

HOW TO PLAY IT
after downloading the folder start the index.html file to play the game in your browser. Use the slider to increment/decrement the speed of the algorithm
